title   : WHAT WE LOVE TO DO
subtitle: Over the years running a business has thought me to keep things simple and costumer oriented. There’s no need to complicate procedures. Although that might be easier said than done, at Michel Real Estate you won’t deal with a multitude of different agents, secretaries and assistants. You’ll be in direct contact with me whenever and wherever it suits you. Your time is precious. For this simple reason we meet with clients when it fits their schedule, whether at the clients home or workplace, morning, evenings or lunchhours.
